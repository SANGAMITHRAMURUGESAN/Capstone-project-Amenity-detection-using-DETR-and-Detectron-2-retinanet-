The plan is to develop the idea as a stand-alone web application based on deep learning principles. The tool can detect different amenities within the property from images and provide a list of items detected. This list is then used to incorporate additional capabilities within the tool in the form of inventory tracking. This feature will help the owners continuously monitor the amenities, track missing items, and supervise the premises of the property. In addition, such a tool can be built as an integration for platforms like Airbnb and provide customized solutions to make the platform extremely helpful for renters
